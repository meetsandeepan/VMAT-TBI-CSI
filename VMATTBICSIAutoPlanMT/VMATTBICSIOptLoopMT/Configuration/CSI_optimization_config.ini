%decision threshold (relative threshold used to determine if the dose or the priority should be adjusted)
%if the relative cost for optimizing and OAR is greater than this threshold, the dose is decreased. OTHERWISE
%the priority is increased
decision threshold=0.15
%
%Lower dose limit
%This parameter prevents the algorithm from pushing the dose for an OAR constraint too low. I.e., the lower dose limit
%will be Rx dose*lower dose limit
relative lower dose limit=0.1

%add reminders to prompt user to confirm that certain items were compeleted before starting optimization
